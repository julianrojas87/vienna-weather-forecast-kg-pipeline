## RDF-Connect Tutorial

This tutorial walks you step by step through building a **provenance-aware, streaming RDF pipeline** using the language-agnostic framework **RDF-Connect**.  

The use case: ingesting weather forecast data for Vienna from the **GeoSphere Austria API** into a queryable **knowledge graph**.

You will:

- Set up an RDF-Connect environment  
- Configure pipeline components  
- Implement processors in multiple programming languages  
- Run the pipeline end-to-end

By the end, you will have:

- A working RDF-Connect pipeline for real-world data  
- A clear understanding of how to integrate heterogeneous processors across languages  
- Practical experience with implementing RDF-Connect processors

The tutorial is designed for all experience levels, and you can follow along at your own pace.  
Each **task** builds on the previous one, and each solution is available in a dedicated **branch** of this repository (`task-1`, `task-2`, ...).  
You can use these branches to verify your work, catch up if stuck, or compare with the reference solution.

## Getting Started

The recommended starting point is to **fork and clone this repository**, then switch to the `main` branch.

### Prerequisites

Make sure the following are installed:

- **Node.js â‰¥16**  
- **Java â‰¥11**  
- **Python â‰¥3.8** (we recommend 3.13 for Part 2)  

The pipeline will store data in a **Virtuoso triple store**.  
We recommend running Virtuoso via **Docker + Docker Compose**, so install both if you plan to follow that setup.
You can also use your own Virtuoso instance if you prefer.

## Tasks

### Part 1: Assembling the Pipeline

#### Task 0: Set up the project structure for the pipeline

In this step, youâ€™ll prepare the project with an empty pipeline config.  
You may start from our provided project structure (recommended) or consult the [example pipelines](https://github.com/rdf-connect/example-pipelines/tree/main/java/hello-world) repository for inspiration.

**Steps:**

- [x] Create a `pipeline/` directory (all Part 1 work happens here).  
- [x] Inside `pipeline/`, create:
  - `pipeline.ttl` (pipeline configuration)  
  - `README.md` (documentation)  
  - `package.json` (via `npm init` or manually)  
  - `.gitignore` (exclude `node_modules/` etc.)  
- [x] Install the orchestrator:  
  ```bash
  npm install @rdfc/orchestrator-js
  ```  
- [x] Initialize the RDF-Connect pipeline in `pipeline.ttl`:
  - Add RDF namespaces (e.g., `rdfc`, `owl`, `ex`)
  - Declare the pipeline with `<> a rdfc:Pipeline`

**Expected structure:**

```
â”œâ”€â”€ pipeline/           # Part 1 work lives here
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ node_modules/   
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore      
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ package.json    
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pipeline.ttl    
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md       
â”œâ”€â”€ processor/          # Custom processor (Part 2)
â””â”€â”€ README.md           # Tutorial instructions
```

âœ… The solution for this task is in the **`main` branch**.


#### Task 1: Fetch weather data as JSON

Configure the pipeline to fetch weather data from GeoSphere Austria (station `11035`, near the SEMANTiCS venue):

- API endpoint:  
  <https://dataset.api.hub.geosphere.at/v1/station/current/tawes-v1-10min?parameters=TL,RR&station_ids=11035>

**Steps:**

- [x] Add an `rdfc:HttpFetch` processor (from [@rdfc/http-utils-processor-ts](https://github.com/rdf-connect/http-utils-processor-ts))  
  - Configure it to fetch from the API endpoint  
  - Define input/output channels  
  - Import definition via `owl:imports`  
- [x] Add an `rdfc:NodeRunner` (from [@rdfc/js-runner](https://github.com/rdf-connect/js-runner))  
  - Import and attach it to the pipeline  
  - Connect it to the `rdfc:HttpFetch` processor using the `rdfc:processor` property
- [x] Add a `rdfc:LogProcessorJs` (from [@rdfc/log-processor-ts](https://github.com/rdf-connect/log-processor-ts))  
  - Configure it with e.g., log level: `info` & label: `output`  
  - Connect the output channel of `rdfc:HttpFetch` to its input channel
  - Import its definition and attach it to the `rdfc:NodeRunner`
- [x] Run the pipeline:  
  ```bash
  npx rdfc pipeline.ttl
  # or with debug logging:
  LOG_LEVEL=debug npx rdfc pipeline.ttl
  ```

âœ… Solution available in **`task-1` branch**.


#### Task 2: Convert JSON to RDF

You will now convert the JSON stream into RDF using **[RML](https://rml.io/)** with the help of the `rdfc:RmlMapper` processor.

To help you with this, we prepared an [RML mapping file](./pipeline/resources/mapping.rml.ttl) for you that you can use to convert the JSON data to RDF.

**Processors to use:**

- `rdfc:GlobRead` â€“ read mapping file ([@rdfc/file-utils-processors-ts](https://github.com/rdf-connect/file-utils-processors-ts))  
- `rdfc:RmlMapper` â€“ convert JSON to RDF ([rml-processor-jvm](https://github.com/rdf-connect/rml-processor-jvm))  
- `rdfc:JvmRunner` â€“ run Java processors ([rdf-connect/jvm-runner](https://github.com/rdf-connect/jvm-runner))  

**Steps:**

- [x] Use `rdfc:GlobRead` to read the RML mapping file
  -  Configure it to read the mapping file from where you saved it (e.g., `./resources/mapping.rml.ttl`)  
  -  Import its definition and attach it to the existing `rdfc:NodeRunner`
- [x] Pass mapping + JSON into `rdfc:RmlMapper`  
- [x] Add the `rdfc:RmlMapper` (from [rml-processor-jvm](https://github.com/rdf-connect/rml-processor-jvm))
  - Configure the input/output channels
  - Import its definition via `owl:imports`
- [x] Add an `rdfc:JvmRunner` (from [rdf-connect/jvm-runner](https://github.com/rdf-connect/jvm-runner))
  - Import and attach it to the pipeline
  - Connect the `rdfc:RmlMapper` processor to it using the `rdfc:processor` property
- [x] Redirect the logging processor to log **RDF output** instead of raw JSON  

âœ… Solution available in **`task-2` branch**.


#### Task 3: Validate RDF with SHACL

Next, validate the RDF output against a provided SHACL shape.

To help you with this, we prepared a [SHACL shape file](./pipeline/resources/shacl-shape.ttl) for you that you can use to validate the RDF data.


**Processors:**

- `rdfc:Validate` â€“ validate RDF data using a SHACL shape ([@rdfc/shacl-processor-ts](https://github.com/rdf-connect/shacl-processor-ts))  
- Another `rdfc:LogProcessorJs` â€“ log validation reports  

**Steps:**

- [ ] Add the `rdfc:Validate` (from [@rdfc/shacl-processor-ts](https://github.com/rdf-connect/shacl-processor-ts))
  - Configure it to use the provided SHACL shape file
  - Define input/output channels
  - Import its definition via `owl:imports`
  - Attach it to the existing `rdfc:NodeRunner`
- [ ] Log only valid data through the first logger  
- [ ] Log reports at `warn` level with the second logger  

âœ… Solution available in **`task-3` branch**.


#### Task 4: Ingest RDF into Virtuoso

Finally, ingest the validated data into a **Virtuoso triple store** (via Docker Compose, or your own instance).

To help you with this, we prepared a [Docker Compose file](./pipeline/resources/docker-compose.yml) for you that you can use to run a Virtuoso instance via Docker.
The instance provided in the Docker Compose file is configured to be accessible at `http://localhost:8890/sparql` with SPARQL update enabled.

**Processors:**

- `rdfc:Sdsify` â€“ convert RDF to SDS records ([@rdfc/sds-processors-ts](https://github.com/rdf-connect/sds-processors-ts))  
- `rdfc:SPARQLIngest` â€“ send SDS records to Virtuoso ([@rdfc/sparql-ingest-processor-ts](https://github.com/rdf-connect/sparql-ingest-processor-ts))  

**Steps:**

- [ ] Convert validated RDF to SDS records with `rdfc:Sdsify` (from [@rdfc/sds-processors-ts](https://github.com/rdf-connect/sds-processors-ts))
  - Configure it with input/output channels and an SDS stream ID (e.g., `http://ex.org/ViennaWeather`)  
  - Import its definition via `owl:imports`  
  - Attach it to the existing `rdfc:NodeRunner`
- [ ] Add the `rdfc:SPARQLIngest` (from [@rdfc/sparql-ingest-processor-ts](https://github.com/rdf-connect/sparql-ingest-processor-ts))
  - Configure it to use the Virtuoso SPARQL endpoint (e.g., `http://localhost:8890/sparql`)  
  - Define input/output channels  
  - Import its definition and attach it to the `rdfc:NodeRunner`
- [ ] Change the input channel of the first `rdfc:LogProcessorJs` processor to the output channel of the `rdfc:SPARQLIngest` processor to log the SPARQL queries that are sent to the Virtuoso instance.

âœ… Solution available in **`task-4` branch**.  

ðŸŽ‰ You have now completed **Part 1**! Your pipeline fetches, converts, validates, and ingests Viennaâ€™s weather forecast into Virtuoso. You can query the data using SPARQL.

### Part 2: Implementing a Custom Processor

The data includes **German literals** (`@de`). To make it more accessible, we will implement a **custom Python processor** that translates them into English (`@en`) using a lightweight local ML model from Hugging Face.

#### Task 5: Set up the processor project

As you might have noticed, we have worked in the `pipeline/` directory for the first part of the tutorial.
However, there is also a `processor/` directory in the root of the project.
This is where you will implement the custom Python processor in this part of the tutorial.

To kickstart the development of a new processor, the RDF-Connect ecosystem provides template repositories that you can use as a starting point, allowing you to directly dive into the actual processor logic without having to worry about the project setup and configuration.
We will use the [template-processor-py](https://github.com/rdf-connect/template-processor-py) repository as a starting point.

**Steps:**

- [ ] Either clone the template or use the preconfigured project in `processor/`  
- [ ] Install dependencies (see template `README.md`)  
- [ ] Rename the template processor (e.g., `TranslationProcessor`) in `processor.py`, `processor.ttl`, `pyproject.toml`, and `README.md`
  - See "Next Steps" in the `README.md` file of the template repository for guidance.
- [ ] Build and verify  

âœ… Solution in **`task-5` branch**


#### Task 6: Implement translation logic

Weâ€™ll translate German literals using the Hugging Face model [Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-de-en](https://huggingface.co/Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-de-en).

**Steps:**

- [ ] Install `transformers`:  
  ```bash
  uv add transformers
  ```  
- [ ] Load the model + tokenizer in `TranslationProcessor.init`  
- [ ] In `transform`, implement the logic to translate language-tagged literals:
  - parse triples with `rdflib`  
  - Identify literals with `@de`  
  - Translate to English  
  - Emit both original and translated triples  
- [ ] (Optional) Add unit tests  
- [ ] Build the project  

âœ… Solution in **`task-6` branch**


#### Task 7: Integrate the processor into the pipeline

Run your Python processor inside the pipeline with `rdfc:PyRunner` ([rdf-connect/py-runner](https://github.com/rdf-connect/py-runner)).

**Steps:**

- [ ] Build the processor into a package  
- [ ] Add a `pyproject.toml` in `pipeline/`
  - Specify the Python version to use to one specific version (e.g., `==3.13.*`). You need this to have a deterministic path for the `owl:imports` statement
  - Configure `[tool.hatch.envs.default]` to use a virtual environment called `.venv`
- [ ] Install your built processor locally with `uv add ../processor/dist/your-processor.tar.gz`  
- [ ] Add `rdfc:PyRunner` to the pipeline and attach your processor (from [rdf-connect/py-runner](https://github.com/rdf-connect/py-runner))
- [ ] Connect it between the RML step and the SHACL validator  

âœ… Solution in **`task-7` branch**  

ðŸŽ‰ You have now completed **Part 2**! The full pipeline now **translates German literals to English** before validation and ingestion into Virtuoso. Run the pipeline with:  

```bash
npx rdfc pipeline.ttl
# or with debug logs:
LOG_LEVEL=debug npx rdfc pipeline.ttl
```

Query Virtuoso and confirm the translated literals are present.
